# Contribution Guidelines

GM Guys,

As we start collaborating on our project, hereâ€™s a quick guide on how to make edits to the files in our repository and submit a pull request for review:

### Basic Workflow for Contributing:

1. Clone the Repository:
   - Use the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/Marvy247/DemoRepo.git
     ```

2. Create a New Branch:
   - Before making any changes, create a new branch for your work:
     ```
     git checkout -b your-branch-name
     ```

3. **Pull the Latest Changes**:
   - Always pull the latest changes from the `main` branch to avoid conflicts:
     ```
     git pull origin main
     ```

4. Make Your Edits:
   - Open the files you want to edit and make your changes. Be sure to save your work.

5. Stage Your Changes:
   - After making edits, stage the changes for commit:
     ```
     git add .
     ```

6. Commit Your Changes:
   - Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
     ```
     git commit -m "Description of changes made"
     ```

7. Push Your Branch to the Remote Repository:
   - Push your new branch to the remote repository:
     ```
     git push origin your-feature-branch
     ```

8. Create a Pull Request:
   - Go to the repository on GitHub and you will see an option to create a pull request for your newly pushed branch. Click on it and provide a description of your changes.

9. Wait for Review:
   - Once you submit the pull request, I will review your changes and merge them into the main branch if everything looks good.
   - To save time Please drop a message on the Whatsapp group once you've made a pull request.

### Important Notes:
- Always pull the latest changes from the `main` branch before starting your work to avoid conflicts.
- If you encounter any issues, feel free to drop me a Message on Whatsapp.

Best of luck to us!

Best,
The Dude.
